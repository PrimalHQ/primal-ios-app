//                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
//                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
//
// Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
// Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
// of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
//
//                           Preamble
//
//   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
// software and other kinds of works.
// 
//   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
// to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
// the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
// share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
// software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
// GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
// any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
// your programs, too.
// 
//   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
// price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
// have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
// them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
// want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
// free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
// 
//   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
// these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
// certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
// you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
// 
//   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
// gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
// freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
// or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
// know their rights.
// 
//   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
// (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
// giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
// 
//   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
// that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
// authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
// changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
// authors of previous versions.
// 
//   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
// modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
// can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
// protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
// pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
// use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
// have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
// products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
// stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
// of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
// 
//   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
// States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
// software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
// avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
// make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
// patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
// 
//   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
// modification follow.
// 
//                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
// 
//   0. Definitions.
// 
//   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
// 
//   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
// works, such as semiconductor masks.
// 
//   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
// License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
// "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
// 
//   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
// in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
// exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
// earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
// 
//   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
// on the Program.
// 
//   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
// permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
// infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
// computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
// distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
// public, and in some countries other activities as well.
// 
//   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
// parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
// a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
// 
//   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
// to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
// feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
// tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
// extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
// work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
// the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
// menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
// 
//   1. Source Code.
// 
//   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
// for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
// form of a work.
// 
//   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
// standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
// interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
// is widely used among developers working in that language.
// 
//   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
// than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
// packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
// Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
// Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
// implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
// "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
// (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
// (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
// produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
// 
//   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
// the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
// work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
// control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
// System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
// programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
// which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
// includes interface definition files associated with source files for
// the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
// linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
// such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
// subprograms and other parts of the work.
// 
//   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
// can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
// Source.
// 
//   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
// same work.
// 
//   2. Basic Permissions.
// 
//   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
// copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
// conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
// permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
// covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
// content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
// rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
// 
//   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
// convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
// in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
// of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
// with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
// the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
// not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
// for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
// and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
// your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
// 
//   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
// the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
// makes it unnecessary.
// 
//   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
// 
//   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
// measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
// 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
// similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
// measures.
// 
//   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
// circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
// is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
// the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
// modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
// users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
// technological measures.
// 
//   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
// 
//   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
// receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
// appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
// keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
// non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
// keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
// recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
// 
//   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
// and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
// 
//   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
// 
//   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
// produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
// terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
// 
//     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
//     it, and giving a relevant date.
// 
//     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
//     released under this License and any conditions added under section
//     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
//     "keep intact all notices".
// 
//     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
//     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
//     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
//     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
//     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
//     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
//     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
// 
//     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
//     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
//     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
//     work need not make them do so.
// 
//   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
// works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
// and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
// in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
// "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
// used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
// beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
// in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
// parts of the aggregate.
// 
//   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
// 
//   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
// of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
// machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
// in one of these ways:
// 
//     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
//     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
//     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
//     customarily used for software interchange.
// 
//     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
//     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
//     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
//     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
//     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
//     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
//     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
//     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
//     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
//     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
//     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
// 
//     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
//     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
//     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
//     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
//     with subsection 6b.
// 
//     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
//     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
//     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
//     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
//     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
//     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
//     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
//     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
//     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
//     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
//     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
//     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
// 
//     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
//     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
//     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
//     charge under subsection 6d.
// 
//   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
// from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
// included in conveying the object code work.
// 
//   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
// tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
// or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
// into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
// doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
// product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
// typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
// of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
// actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
// is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
// commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
// the only significant mode of use of the product.
// 
//   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
// procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
// and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
// a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
// suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
// code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
// modification has been made.
// 
//   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
// specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
// part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
// User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
// fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
// Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
// by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
// if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
// modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
// been installed in ROM).
// 
//   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
// requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
// for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
// the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
// network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
// adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
// protocols for communication across the network.
// 
//   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
// in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
// documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
// source code form), and must require no special password or key for
// unpacking, reading or copying.
// 
//   7. Additional Terms.
// 
//   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
// License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
// Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
// be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
// that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
// apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
// under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
// this License without regard to the additional permissions.
// 
//   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
// remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
// it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
// removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
// additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
// for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
// 
//   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
// add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
// that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
// 
//     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
//     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
// 
//     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
//     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
//     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
// 
//     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
//     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
//     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
// 
//     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
//     authors of the material; or
// 
//     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
//     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
// 
//     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
//     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
//     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
//     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
//     those licensors and authors.
// 
//   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
// restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
// received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
// governed by this License along with a term that is a further
// restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
// a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
// License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
// of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
// not survive such relicensing or conveying.
// 
//   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
// must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
// additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
// where to find the applicable terms.
// 
//   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
// form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
// the above requirements apply either way.
// 
//   8. Termination.
// 
//   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
// provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
// modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
// this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
// paragraph of section 11).
// 
//   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
// license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
// provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
// finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
// holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
// prior to 60 days after the cessation.
// 
//   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
// reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
// violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
// received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
// copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
// your receipt of the notice.
// 
//   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
// licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
// this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
// reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
// material under section 10.
// 
//   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
// 
//   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
// run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
// occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
// to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
// nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
// modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
// not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
// covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
// 
//   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
// 
//   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
// receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
// propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
// for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
// 
//   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
// organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
// organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
// work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
// transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
// licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
// give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
// Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
// the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
// 
//   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
// rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
// not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
// rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
// (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
// any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
// sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
// 
//   11. Patents.
// 
//   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
// License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
// work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
// 
//   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
// owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
// hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
// by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
// but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
// consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
// purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
// patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
// this License.
// 
//   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
// patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
// make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
// propagate the contents of its contributor version.
// 
//   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
// agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
// (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
// sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
// party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
// patent against the party.
// 
//   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
// and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
// to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
// publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
// then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
// available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
// patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
// consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
// license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
// actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
// covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
// in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
// country that you have reason to believe are valid.
// 
//   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
// arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
// covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
// receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
// or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
// you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
// work and works based on it.
// 
//   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
// the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
// conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
// specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
// work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
// in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
// to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
// the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
// parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
// patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
// conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
// for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
// contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
// or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
// 
//   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
// any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
// otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
// 
//   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
// 
//   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
// otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
// excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
// covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
// License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
// not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
// to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
// the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
// License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
// 
//   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
// 
//   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
// permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
// under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
// combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
// License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
// but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
// section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
// combination as such.
// 
//   14. Revised Versions of this License.
// 
//   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
// the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
// be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
// address new problems or concerns.
// 
//   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
// Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
// Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
// option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
// version or of any later version published by the Free Software
// Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
// GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
// by the Free Software Foundation.
// 
//   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
// versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
// public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
// to choose that version for the Program.
// 
//   Later license versions may give you additional or different

// author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
// later version.
// 
//   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
// 
//   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY

//   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
// 
//   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided

//             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
// 
//   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
// possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
// free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
// 
//   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
// to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
// state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
// the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
// 
//     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
